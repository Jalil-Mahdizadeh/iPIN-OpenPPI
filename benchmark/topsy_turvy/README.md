# Topsy-Turvy benchmark

Status: planned; no model downloaded, trained, or evaluated.

Upstream: [official repository](https://github.com/samsledje/D-SCRIPT).

Required comparison: authors' original released predictor and a separately identified predictor retrained on iPIN TRAIN, each evaluated on the identical C1/C2/C3 test cells against the frozen baseline and optimized iPIN ensembles. Development data alone determine retraining choices. Original-checkpoint interaction exposure is disclosed; an original training objective is not an original pretrained model.

All candidate-specific code, configurations, downloads, data, weights, runs, logs, and reports belong in this directory. Shared containers belong in `../containers/`; reuse of an existing read-only repository SIF requires recorded dependency and numerical qualification. Existing repository data/models are read-only inputs.

If an original checkpoint is unavailable or cannot be reproduced faithfully, report that limitation explicitly rather than substituting a newly trained model under the original label.
